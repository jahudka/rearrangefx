No, seriously, I don't suppose everybody\r\ntinkers around with their FX folders two to three hours every day; the tools provided in REAPER are probably\r\nperfectly sufficient for most people. But I just SO had to be able to organize the folders using drag'n'drop\r\nthat I ended up writing my own app for it.\r\n\r\nWait, whaaaaat...?\r\n------------------\r\nYes! You understood right. The one and only reason I started writing this app is that I cannot change the order\r\nof my custom FX folders in REAPER via drag'n'drop.\r\n\r\nSo, whaaaaat....?\r\n-----------------\r\nDownload, unzip, run. If you have a really weird setup (ie. REAPER data directory doesn't sit at `%appData%/REAPER`),\r\nthe app will start by showing you the Preferences pane, which surprisingly contains only one setting - the path\r\nto the REAPER data directory.\r\n\r\nThe app shows two panels: on the left you have an expandable list showing your current folder structure, on the right\r\nthere is a panel showing <del>all your available plugins</del> (actually, it only shows plugins which already are\r\nin at least one folder). Now you can drag your folders and plugins all you like. And, more importantly, so can I.\r\n\r\nNote that the app only works with the one `.ini` file which holds the custom FX folders structure. In other words,\r\nthe app doesn't look for available plugins the way REAPER does; I'm not even remotely sure how would I go about doing\r\nthat, and besides the result probably wouldn't work well enough to justify the amount of work I'd have to put in to even\r\nget close. As a result, as stated above, you can only ever work with plugins that you added to at least _one_ user \r\nfolder using the REAPER FX window. One easy way to work around this is that you can create a folder called \"All plugins\"\r\nand just drag all of your plugins into that folder within REAPER, then you can quit REAPER and do the rest of your\r\nadjustments using RearrangeFX. \r\n\r\nMore info\r\n---------\r\nIf you'd like to get more behind-the-scenes info on RearrangeFX, head straight over to the app's [GitHub repo home](https://github.com/jahudka/rearrangefx), there's a little more about the build process in the readme.\r\n","google":"UA-72021901-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
