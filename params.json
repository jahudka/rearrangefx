No, seriously, I don't suppose everybody\r\ntinkers around with their FX folders two to three hours every day; the tools provided in REAPER are probably\r\nperfectly sufficient for most people. But I just SO had to be able to organize the folders using drag'n'drop\r\nthat I ended up writing my own app for it.\r\n\r\nWait, whaaaaat...?\r\n------------------\r\nYes! You understood right. The one and only reason I started writing this app is that I cannot change the order\r\nof my custom FX folders in REAPER via drag'n'drop.\r\n\r\nSo, whaaaaat....?\r\n-----------------\r\nDownload, unzip, run. If you have a really weird setup (ie. REAPER data directory doesn't sit at %appData%/REAPER),\r\nthe app will start by showing you the Preferences pane, which surprisingly contains only one setting - the path\r\nto the REAPER data directory.\r\n\r\nThe app shows two panels: on the left you have an expandable list showing your current folder structure, on the right\r\nthere is a panel showing <del>all your available plugins</del> (actually, it only shows plugins which already are\r\nin at least one folder). Now you can drag your folders and plugins all you like. And, more importantly, so can I. \r\n\r\nMore info\r\n---------\r\nIf you'd like to get more behind-the-scenes info on RearrangeFX, head straight over to the app's [GitHub repo home](https://github.com/jahudka/rearrangefx), there's a little more about the build process in the readme.\r\n","google":"UA-72021901-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
