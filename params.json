No, seriously, I don't suppose everybody\r\ntinkers around with their FX folders two to three hours every day; the tools provided in REAPER are probably\r\nperfectly sufficient for most people. But I just SO had to be able to organize the folders using drag'n'drop\r\nthat I ended up writing my own app for it.\r\n\r\nWait, whaaaaat...?\r\n------------------\r\nYes! You understood right. The one and only reason I started writing this app is that I cannot change the order\r\nof my custom FX folders in REAPER via drag'n'drop.\r\n\r\nSo, whaaaaat....?\r\n-----------------\r\nDownload, unzip, run. If you have a really weird setup (ie. REAPER data directory doesn't sit at `%appData%/REAPER`),\r\nthe app will start by showing you the Preferences pane.\r\n\r\nThe app has two main view modes: folder sorting and plugin assignment. Folder sorting just shows a list of all your\r\nFX folders and allows you to add new folders, rename or remove existing ones and - most importantly - sort them\r\nusing drag & drop. The plugin assignment view shows a grid similar to REAPER's region / group matrix, allowing you\r\nto swiftly assign your plugins to all the folders you want them in.\r\n\r\nNote that the app only works with the one `.ini` file which holds the custom FX folders structure. In other words,\r\nthe app doesn't look for available plugins the way REAPER does; I haven't the faintest idea how would I go about doing\r\nthat, and besides the result probably wouldn't work well enough to justify the amount of work I'd have to put in to even\r\nget close. As a result, you can only ever work with plugins that you already added to at least _one_ user\r\nfolder using the REAPER FX window. One easy way to work around this is that you can create a folder called \"All plugins\"\r\nand just drag all of your plugins into that folder within REAPER, then you can quit REAPER and do the rest of your\r\nadjustments using RearrangeFX.\r\n\r\nMore info\r\n---------\r\nRearrangeFX is really just a placeholder app until such a time as the guys over at Cockos inc. implement drag'n'drop in the My Folders list, which probably won't take forever. This means that RearrangeFX won't be developed forever. It doesn't mean I won't be there to fix bugs, if and when anybody reports them. If you find a bug, you can [send me an email](mailto:me@subsonic.cz), open an [issue](https://github.com/jahudka/rearrangefx/issues) at Github or post in the [RearrangeFX thread](http://forum.cockos.com/showthread.php?t=170880) over at the REAPER Forum and I'll see what I can do.\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to get more behind-the-scenes info on RearrangeFX, head straight over to the app's [GitHub repo home](https://github.com/jahudka/rearrangefx), there's a little more about the build process in the readme.\r\n",
