No, seriously, I don't suppose everybody\r\ntinkers around with their FX folders two to three hours every day; the tools provided in REAPER are probably\r\nperfectly sufficient for most people. But I just SO had to be able to organize the folders using drag'n'drop\r\nthat I ended up writing my own app for it.\r\n\r\nWait, whaaaaat...?\r\n------------------\r\nYes! You understood right. The one and only reason I started writing this app is that I cannot change the order\r\nof my custom FX folders in REAPER via drag'n'drop.\r\n\r\nSo, whaaaaat....?\r\n-----------------\r\nDownload, unzip, run. If you have a really weird setup (ie. REAPER data directory doesn't sit at %appData%/REAPER),\r\nthe app will start by showing you the Preferences pane, which surprisingly contains only one setting - the path\r\nto the REAPER data directory.\r\n\r\nThe app shows two panels: on the left you have an expandable list showing your current folder structure, on the right\r\nthere is a panel showing <del>all your available plugins</del> (actually, it only shows plugins which already are\r\nin at least one folder). Now you can drag your folders and plugins all you like. And, more importantly, so can I. \r\n\r\nContributing\r\n------------\r\nJust a couple of basic rules I'm sure you already know:\r\n - fork & send pull-request\r\n - don't add IDE project / workspace files to git, add them to .gitignore instead\r\n - above all, respect .editorconfig!\r\n\r\nYou'll need a nwjs runtime (get it at http://nwjs.io) and some node modules (`cd ./src && npm install`). Then you can\r\nrun the app from a terminal using `nwjs .` (assuming your pwd is `./src`).\r\n\r\nBuilding the app is very easy using nwbuilder (cwd to project root):\r\n```\r\nnpm install -g nw-builder\r\nnwbuild --platform osx32 --version 0.12.3 --macIcns src/icons/icon.icns src\r\nnwbuild --platform osx64 --version 0.12.3 --macIcns src/icons/icon.icns src\r\nnwbuild --platform win32 --version 0.12.3 --winIco src/icons/icon.ico src\r\nnwbuild --platform win64 --version 0.12.3 --winIco src/icons/icon.ico src\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that to use the `--winIco` option you need to have Wine installed (assuming you're not a Windows person)\r\nand even then it might not necessarily work (it didn't for me).\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
