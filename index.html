<h2>
<a id="what-is-rearrangefx" class="anchor" href="#what-is-rearrangefx" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What is RearrangeFX?</h2>

<p>RearrangeFX is a bare-bones tool you can use to manage your "My Folders" in the Add FX dialog in REAPER.
The main issue with the built-in tools being that they suck. No, seriously, I don't suppose everybody
tinkers around with their FX folders two to three hours every day; the tools provided in REAPER are probably
perfectly sufficient for most people. But I just SO had to be able to organize the folders using drag'n'drop
that I ended up writing my own app for it.</p>

<h2>
<a id="wait-whaaaaat" class="anchor" href="#wait-whaaaaat" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Wait, whaaaaat...?</h2>

<p>Yes! You understood right. The one and only reason I started writing this app is that I cannot change the order
of my custom FX folders in REAPER via drag'n'drop.</p>

<h2>
<a id="so-whaaaaat" class="anchor" href="#so-whaaaaat" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>So, whaaaaat....?</h2>

<p>Download, unzip, run. If you have a really weird setup (ie. REAPER data directory doesn't sit at <code>%appData%/REAPER</code>),
the app will start by showing you the Preferences pane, which surprisingly contains only one setting - the path
to the REAPER data directory.</p>

<p>The app shows two panels: on the left you have an expandable list showing your current folder structure, on the right
there is a panel showing <del>all your available plugins</del> (actually, it only shows plugins which already are
in at least one folder). Now you can drag your folders and plugins all you like. And, more importantly, so can I.</p>

<p>Note that the app only works with the one <code>.ini</code> file which holds the custom FX folders structure. In other words,
the app doesn't look for available plugins the way REAPER does; I'm not even remotely sure how would I go about doing
that, and besides the result probably wouldn't work well enough to justify the amount of work I'd have to put in to even
get close. As a result, as stated above, you can only ever work with plugins that you added to at least <em>one</em> user 
folder using the REAPER FX window. One easy way to work around this is that you can create a folder called "All plugins"
and just drag all of your plugins into that folder within REAPER, then you can quit REAPER and do the rest of your
adjustments using RearrangeFX. </p>
