Simplyfying REAPER FX Folder management


What is RearrangeFX?
--------------------
RearrangeFX is a bare-bones tool you can use to manage your "My Folders" in the Add FX dialog in REAPER.
The main issue with the built-in tools being that they suck. No, seriously, I don't suppose everybody
tinkers around with their FX folders two to three hours every day; the tools provided in REAPER are probably
perfectly sufficient for most people. But I just SO had to be able to organize the folders using drag'n'drop
that I ended up writing my own app for it.

Wait, whaaaaat...?
------------------
Yes! You understood right. The one and only reason I started writing this app is that I cannot change the order
of my custom FX folders in REAPER via drag'n'drop.

So, whaaaaat....?
-----------------
Download, unzip, run. If you have a really weird setup (ie. REAPER data directory doesn't sit at %appData%/REAPER),
the app will start by showing you the Preferences pane, which surprisingly contains only one setting - the path
to the REAPER data directory.

The app shows two panels: on the left you have an expandable list showing your current folder structure, on the right
there is a panel showing <del>all your available plugins</del> (actually, it only shows plugins which already are
in at least one folder). Now you can drag your folders and plugins all you like. And, more importantly, so can I.
